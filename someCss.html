        <p style="font-family: 'Permanent Marker', cursive; font-size: 15px;"> The University of Washington (commonly referred to as UW, simply Washington, or informally U-Dub)[5] is a public research university in Seattle, Washington.</p>
        <p style="font-family: 'Indie Flower', cursive; font-size: 20px;"> Founded in 1861, Washington was first established in downtown Seattle approximately a decade after the city's founding to aid its economic development. Today, the university's 703-acre main Seattle campus is situated in the University District above the Montlake Cut, within the urban Puget Sound region of the Pacific Northwest. The university has two additional campuses in Tacoma and Bothell. Overall, UW encompasses over 500 buildings and over 20 million gross square footage of space, including one of the largest library systems in the world with over 26 university libraries, as well as the UW Tower, lecture halls, art centers, museums, laboratories, stadiums, and conference centers. The university offers bachelor's, master's and doctoral degrees through 140 departments in various colleges and schools, sees about 46,000 in total student enrollment every year, and functions on a quarter system.</p>
